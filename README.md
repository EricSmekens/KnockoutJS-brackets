KnockoutJS-brackets
===================

Knockout extension for brackets. It's currently work-in-progress. 
Ideas, contributions and any other support are welcome! :)

What is currently working
-----------
Quick-edit for ko.computed.
(Not works with numbers in computed name and only works when you fully select the computed's name.)
This feature will be extended in next versions.


Currently planning to implement:
-----------
*Unit-tests. 
*More refactoring and improving current ko.computed functionality.

Quick-edit for:
* better quick edit for ko.computed
* ko.observable ?
* subscribes ?
    
* Lint API additions for ko.computed, ko.observable maybe in the future.

Thanks to:
-----------
* Adobe, for creating brackets (and making it open-source).
* The creator of the AngularJS-brackets extension, AngularUI. Gave me inspiration to create this knockout version that works on a the not-deprecated API's.
