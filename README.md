KnockoutJS-brackets
===================

Knockout extension for brackets. It's currently work-in-progress. 
Ideas, contributions and any other support are welcome! :)

Currently planning to implement, in this order:

    Quick-edit for:
        - ko.computed
        - ko.observable
        - subscribes?
    
    Lint API additions for ko.computed, ko.observable maybe in the future.


Thanks to:
    The brackets-team, for brackets.
    AngularUI / Dean Sofer, for creating AngularJS extension, which this extension is based on.
